# Hey Everyone

This is a project that I have done using pygame and minimax algorithm

## Description
Try to open the project and play against AI. It would be impossible for you to win the game because the AI already calculates every possible case of the game. If you can survive the game with a tie that means you are a good player.

Cheers!

## Installation

Once in the directory for the project, run 

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
 to install the required Python package (pygame) for this project.

## Usage

In order to run the project run

```bash
python3 runner.py
```
